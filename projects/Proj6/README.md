# CIS 111 Project 6 (50 points)
# Due Friday, May 8 by midnight


## Description

In this assignment, you will write a Java program that plays a simplified
version of “Hangman”. The computer will pick a random word, and the user will
guess letters until they’ve filled in the entire word. Here is a sample run of the program:

```java

```


## Requirements

This program should contain a single class (called Proj6). This project has been
started for you – you will need to download Proj6.java from K-State Online. Copy
all the text in that file, and when you create a new class in BlueJ, paste the
code into the BlueJ file. Do not change any of the code from that file.

Note: Your project will not initially compile when you first paste in the
starting code. This is because some of the methods are missing return
statements. You will need for finish each method that says “YOU DO THIS” before
the project will compile.

This project contains several methods, each of which contains documentation on
what that method does or is supposed to do. You will need to complete the main,
init, printPuzzle, guessLetter, and solved methods.

**Please also download the words.txt file from K-State Online**, and store it in
the same directory that BlueJ puts your Proj6.java file.


## Documentation

You do not need to document this project, but please do not remove the
documentation that has been provided for you.


## Submission

To submit your project, first create a folder called proj6, and move your
`Proj6.java` file into that folder. (If you used BlueJ, you can skip this step).
Then, right-click on that folder (or the folder you created for your BlueJ
project) and select “`Send To->Compressed (zipped) folder`”. This will create
the file proj6.zip. Go to “`Files and Content->Modules->File Dropbox`” on
K-State Online, and upload the `proj6.zip` file. Put your name and Project 6 in
the description box.


## Grading

Projects will be graded according to the following rubric:

| Requirement | Points |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Format of class and methods | 2 |
| Correct method calls from main | 5 |
| `init` is correct | 5 |
| `solved` is correct | 10 |
| `guessLetter` is correct | 10 |
| `printPuzzle` is correct | 5 |
| Overall correctness – the program plays the simplified Hangman game | 10 |
| Output format exactly matches example | 2 |
| Submission (zip file, used dropbox, included name and project number) | 1 |
| **Total** | **50** |
