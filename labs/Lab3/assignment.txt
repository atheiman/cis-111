Variables, Operations, Output, User Input

- The lab should be done in pairs

Part 1:
- Copy Lab3.java, and paste it into a new BlueJ file
- Try to compile it -- what's wrong?
- Fix all the errors until the program compiles.
- The program is SUPPOSED to get two numbers from the user and print their average.  Does it work?
- Make changes to the program until it works correctly.


Part 2:
- Start a new BlueJ project with a class and main method
- Ask the user to enter a bill amount at a restaurant(as a double)
- Suppose the sales tax is 8.5% and you want to tip 20% after
    adding in the tax
- Calculate and print what the final cost after both tax and tip
- Format it to have just 2 decimal places
- You may want to use the following to format it

import java.text.*;
...
DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#0.00");
...
System.out.println(df.format(some double value));
