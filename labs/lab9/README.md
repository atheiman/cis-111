Lab 9
Objectives:
• Learn how to work with Strings.
Project:
You will create a Java application using BlueJ that prints statistics about a given
sentence.
The program should ask the user to enter a sentence. Once the user presses the “Enter”
key, the program should print out the following statistics:
1. How many vowels are in the sentence.
2. How many consonants are in the sentence.
3. How many words are in the sentence.
4. Print the sentence backward, word by word (e.g. if the sentence was “Print the
sentence backward” then it would print “backward sentence the Print”). Use a
StringTokenizer to get the words.
E.g.:
Enter a sentence? Mary had a little lamb
Vowels: 6
Consonants: 12
Words: 5
Backwards: lamb little a had Mary
User input is in red.
