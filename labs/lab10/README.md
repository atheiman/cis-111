# Lab 10

## Objectives

Learn how to work with methods and parameters.

## Project

You will create a Java application using BlueJ that prints statistics about a
personâ€™s names. The program should ask the user for their first name, then print
the number of vowels and consonants. Ask for their middle name, and then print
the number of vowels and consonants. Ask for their last name, and then print the
number of vowels and consonants. You should use a separate method for printing
the vowels and consonants in a String.

E.g.:

```
Enter first name: Mary
Vowels: 1
Consonants: 3
Enter middle name: Lou
Vowels: 2
Consonants: 1
Enter last name: Henson
Vowels: 2
Consonants: 3
```

Note that this lab is similar to lab 9. The lab 9 solution has been posted to
K-State Online, so you might want to look at it to complete this lab.
