Lab Activity:
- Create the text file nums.txt
  - this file should contain 10 integers, one per line
- Create a new BlueJ project called Lab11
- Store nums.txt in your lab folder
- Create a Lab 11 class that contains:
  - A main method (empty for now)
  - A method that takes an integer parameter and returns its square
- In the main method, open the nums.txt file and read the contents
  into an array
- For each element in the array, print its square (by calling your method)
- Modify your program to print each square to an output file (squares.txt)
